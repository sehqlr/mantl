.. versionadded:: 1.0.3

Terraform can use CLC to provision hosts for your cluster. You
can `download Terraform from terraform.io
<https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html>`_.

Documentation on using the CLC driver with terraform is `available here
<https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/clc/index.html>`_.



NOTE: The CLC driver may not yet be available in the main terraform distribution.
See also https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/terraform-provider-clc if absent. 


Configuring Terraform
-----------------------------

From the project root, copy the template located at
``terraform/clc.sample.tf`` to ``./clc.tf``


In order to provision to CLC via terraform, login credentials are
required. Trial accounts with free credits are available, sign-up
`here <https://www.ctl.io>`_.


Account Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Be sure you have minimally set up you CLC account with the following:

- `A default network <https://control.ctl.io/Network/network/Create>`_

- Recommended: a dedicated user/pass for use in provisioning with terraform
  
  
Provider Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The driver accepts either via environment variables or credentials
inlined as provider config.


By environment variables:

.. envvar:: CLC_USERNAME

.. envvar:: CLC_PASSWORD

.. envvar:: CLC_ACCOUNT



Or conversely, via provider config:

.. code-block:: json

  ...
  variable ssh_key { default = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" }

  provider "clc" {
    username = "<clc username goes here>"
    password = "<clc password goes here>"
    account  = "<clc account goes here>"
  }



Basic Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``location`` is the datacenter where your cluster will be deployed
to. The `clc_group.mantl` server group will hold all the generated
nodes.

``{control|worker|edge}_count`` controls the number of nodes deployed
to each role.

``ssh_pass`` is the initial server password for root. It's advised to
test whatever password provided here before using it against
terraform.

``ssh_key`` is a public key that will be installed into root's
authorized_keys.


Additional settings are available for customization in
``./terraform/clc/node.tf``.




Provisioning
------------

Once you've reviewed and/or modified the settings, ``terraform get``
will prepare your cluster, ``terraform plan`` can be reviewed to check
the deployment, and ``terraform apply`` will provision the
cluster. Afterwards, you can use the instructions in :doc:`getting
started <index>` to install Mantl on your new cluster.
