SoftLayer
*********

New in version 0.3.3.

As of Mantl 0.3.3 you can bring up SoftLayer servers using Terraform.
Mantl uses Terraform to provision hosts.

As of now, the released version of Terraform doesn't have SoftLayer
support, but one can build a *custom binary with SoftLayer
provisioning.<https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/2554>*.


Configuring Terraform for SoftLayer
===================================

Before we can build any servers using Terraform and Ansible, we need
to configure authentication. We'll be filling in the authentication
variables for the template located at "terraform/softlayer.sample.tf".
It looks like this:

   provider "softlayer" {
   }

   module "softlayer-keypair" {
     source = "./terraform/softlayer/keypair"
     public_key_filename = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
   }

   module "softlayer-hosts" {
     source = "./terraform/softlayer/hosts"
     ssh_key = "${module.softlayer-keypair.keypair_id}"

     region_name = "ams01"
     domain = "example.com"
     control_count = 3
     worker_count = 4
     edge_count = 2
   }

Copy that file in it's entirety to the root of the project to start
customization. In the next sections, we'll describe the settings that
you need to configure.


Username and API Key
--------------------

You need to generate an API key for your SoftLayer account. This can
be done in the control panel at
*http://softlayer.com<http://softlayer.com>*.

This token, along with your username, must be put in your softlayer.tf
file. Alternatively, if you don't want to put credentials in the
terraform file, you can set environment variables:

SOFTLAYER_USERNAME

   The SoftLayer username

SOFTLAYER_API_KEY

   The SoftLayer API key


Provisioning
============

Once you're all set up with the provider, customize your modules (for
"control_count" and "worker_count"), run "terraform get" to prepare
Terraform to provision your cluster, "terraform plan" to see what will
be created, and "terraform apply" to provision the cluster.
Afterwards, you can use the instructions in *getting started* to
install Mantl on your new cluster.
