New in version 0.3.

Terraform can use DNSimple to provide DNS records for your cluster,
independent of which provider you use to provision your servers.


DNSimple Username/Token
=======================

The easiest way to configure credentials for DNSimple is by setting
environment variables:

DNSIMPLE_EMAIL

   Your e-mail address for the DNSimple account

DNSIMPLE_TOKEN

   The DNSimple token (found in the DNSimple admin panel)

Alternatively, you can set up the DNSimple provider credentials in
your .tf file:

   provider "dnsimple" {
     token = "your dnsimple token"
     email = "your e-mail address for the dnsimple account"
   }
