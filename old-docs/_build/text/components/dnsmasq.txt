dnsmasq
*******

The project uses dnsmasq to configure each host to use *Consul* for
DNS.

This role also adds (as of Mantl 1.1) search paths for ".consul" and
".node.consul". This means that you can address your nodes by their
consul names directly: if you have a node named "x", you can address
it there or at "x.node", as well as the fully-qualified
"x.node.consul". You can also address services using the shortened
version (for example "zookeeper.service" instead of the full
"zookeeper.service.consul".)


Changes
=======

Starting with version 1.0.4, dnsmasq no longer uses Google's DNS
("8.8.8.8" and "8.8.4.4"), preferring the cloud provider's DNS. If you
want to use the old behavior, add your preferred nameservers to
"/etc/resolv.conf.masq", where DNSMasq will look to load resolvers
after a name is not found in Consul.


Variables
=========

The dnsmasq role uses "consul_dns_domain", "consul_servers_group", and
"consul_dc_group" defined in *Consul*.

mantl_dns_version

   The version of "mantl-dns" to install.

   Default: "1.1.0"
