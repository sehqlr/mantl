Traefik
*******

New in version 0.5.

Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer made to
deploy microservices with ease. It supports several backends (Docker,
Mesos/Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Zookeeper, BoltDB, Rest API, fileâ€¦) to
manage its configuration automatically and dynamically.

Traefik is used as the only work role on the edge nodes. You should
customize "traefik_marathon_domain" to set a domain (for example
"apps.yourdomain.com") and then set an A record for each of the edge
servers to "*.apps.yourdomain.com".


Migrating from haproxy
======================

In 0.5, this role replaces haproxy. To migrate, set
"traefik_marathon_domain" to whatever was previously the value of
"haproxy_domain" and make sure your customized config has the new role
from "sample.yml".


Variables
=========

You can use these variables to customize your Traefik installation.

traefik_marathon_endpoint

   The endpoint that Marathon talks to. Do not change this unless you
   are using non-default security settings (namely, if you have
   iptables disabled, this could also be set to
   "http://marathon.service.consul:8080")

   default: "http://marathon.service.consul:18080"

traefik_marathon_domain

   The domain that Traefik will match hosts on by default (you can
   change this on a per-app basis)

   default: "marathon.localhost"

traefik_marathon_expose_by_default

   Automatically expose Marathon applications in traefik.

   The traefik default is "false", or not forward traffic.

   The mantl default is set to "true".
