Components
**********

Mantl is made up of a number of components which can be customized,
generally using Ansible variables.

* Calico

* Chronos

* Collectd

* Consul

* Distributive

* dnsmasq

* Docker

* ELK

* etcd

* GlusterFS

* Haproxy

* Kafka

* Kubernetes

* Logstash

* Marathon

* Mesos

* Traefik

* ZooKeeper

The project also includes a number of Ansible roles that multiple
components can use:

* Common

* consul-template

* logrotate

* Nginx

The following technology previews are also included. These may be used
more fully in the future, but now just exist for preview purposes to
gather feedback and build initial implementations against:

* Vault

Mantl includes some logic that is provided via our own packaging
system, and so is not visible in the Ansible roles. Here are the links
to our package sources:

   * mantl-packaging

   * mesos-packaging
