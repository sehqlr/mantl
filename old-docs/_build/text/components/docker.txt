Docker
******

New in version 0.1.

Docker is a container manager and scheduler. In their words, it
"allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies
into a standardized unit for software development." Their site has
more on what Docker is. We use it in Mantl to ship units of work
around the cluster, combined with *Marathon*'s scheduling.


Variables
=========

docker_source

   Specify origin of docker packages.

   Possible values:  "docker", "redhat".

   Default: "docker` -- using packages from ``Docker, inc".


Using a private Docker registry
===============================

In addition to the open, official Docker registry at
https://hub.docker.com, one can use a private in-house docker registry
for storing and pulling images. Docker Hub also supports storing
private images.

One must configure credentials in order to use private repositories.
This is done with the security-setup script, run it with the flag "--
use-private-docker-registry=true". It will then ask you for username,
password and e-mail address for the registry user. You can also
specify a custom URL for an in-house Docker registry, or omit it, in
which case it will default to the official registry,
https://index.docker.io/v1/.

In addition to configuring access to the specified private docker
registries, this will also create an archive that can be used to
supply credentials to Marathon tasks that require access to those
registries. You can specify the path to the generated credentials
archive in the "uris" key of your Marathon app definition:

   ...
   "uris": [
     "file:///etc/docker.tar.gz"
   ],
   ...

See the Marathon documentation for more information.
