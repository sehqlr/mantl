Haproxy
*******

New in version 0.2.

Warning: Haproxy is deprecated as of Mantl 0.5. Please migrate to
  *Traefik* at your earliest convenience.

Haproxy connects to *Consul*, and proxies all registered services. At
the current time all containers are mapped to port 80. Future versions
will allow each container to control the haproxy port and url mapping.


Variables
=========

Depends on "haproxy_domain", as we use host_acl on the hostname in the
request.

haproxy_image

   default: "asteris/haproxy-consul"

haproxy_image_tag

   default: "latest"

haproxy_domain

   default: "example.com"

   The domain that haproxy will use to match url requests. For example
   if this is set to example.com, apps "myapp" and "hello-world" will
   be mapped to "myapp.example.com", "hello-world.example.com".

   For this to work, you need to have a wildcard dns entry for
   "*.example.com", so when your browser goes to
   "http://myapp.example.com", your DNS settings forward that traffic
   to one of the nodes running haproxy.


Making haproxy work with the DNS setup from Terraform
=====================================================

The Terraform files in Mantl are set up to create DNS records in the
form of "*.[short-name]-lb.[domain]", e.g. **.mi-lb.example.com*. In
order to set up haproxy to work with these DNS records, set
haproxy_domain to "[short-name]-lb.[domain]", replacing "[short-name]"
and "[domain]" with your values. Then, you can access "myapp" at
"myapp.[short-name]-lb.[domain]" ("myapp.mi-lb.example.com")
