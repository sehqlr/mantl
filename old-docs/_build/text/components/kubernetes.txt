Kubernetes
**********

New in version 1.1.

From Kubernetes.io:

   Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment,
   operations, and scaling of containerized applications.

Since version 1.1, Mantl ships Kubernetes by default. All you need to
do is set the "kubeworker_count" and "kubeworker_type" variables in
your Terraform configuration (see the example Terraform configurations
for where this variable integrates into the workflow.)

*kubectl* is installed and configured for the default SSH user on the
control nodes. Please refer to the Kubernetes getting started
documentation for how to use Kubernetes.

To talk to the services launched inside Kubernetes, launch them with
the "NodePort" service type (more on what service types are
available), then connect on the assigned port on any Kubernetes worker
node. Consul service integration will happen in a future release.
