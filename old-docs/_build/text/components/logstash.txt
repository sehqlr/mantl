Logstash
********

Logging role for deploying and managing Logstash with Docker and
systemd as a part of the ELK stack.


Variables
=========

You can use these variables to customize your Logstash installations:

logstash_output_stdout

   A simple output which prints to the STDOUT

   Default: false

logstash_output_elasticsearch

   Configures an elasticsearch output for the local Logstash agent on
   all nodes. You can set this variable to a dictionary that maps to
   the Logstash Elasticsearch output settings.

   This is not needed if you are planning to use the Mantl ELK addon.
   Use this if you want to send Logstash data to an Elasticsearch
   cluster that is not managed by Mantl.

   Example:

   logstash_output_elasticsearch:
     host: "elasticsearch.example.com"
     protocol: "http"

logstash_output_kafka

   Configures an elasticsearch output for a Kafka cluster. You can set
   this variable to a dictionary that maps to the Logstash Kafka
   output settings.

   Default: n/a

   Example:

   logstash_output_kafka:
     broker_list: "broker1:port,broker2:port,..."
     topic_id: "logstash"

logstash_input_log4j

   Read events over a TCP socket from a Log4j SocketAppender

   Default: false
