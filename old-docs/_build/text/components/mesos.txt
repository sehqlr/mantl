Mesos
*****

New in version 0.1.

Mesos is the distributed system kernel that manages resources across
multiple nodes. When combined with *Marathon*, you can basically think
of it as a distributed init system.


Modes
=====

Mesos can be run in one of two "modes":

   * A server mode (called "master" or "leader")

   * A client mode (called "follower" or "agent". The term "slave"
     is used but deprecated.)

This project prefers the "leader/follower nomenclature". In addition
to the "official" modes described below, "mesos_mode" supports running
both modes on a single machine for testing or development scenarios.


Leader
------

Leaders will communicate with each other via *ZooKeeper* to coordinate
which leader controls the cluster. Because of this, you can run as
many leader nodes as you like, but you should consider keeping an odd
number in the cluster to make attaining a quorum easier. A single
leader node will also work fine, but will not be highly available.


Follower
--------

Follower nodes need to know where the leaders are, and there can be
any number of them. You should keep the follower machines free of
"heavier" services running outside Mesos, as this will cause
inaccurate resource availability counts in the cluster.


Upgrading
=========

New in version 1.0.

If you are running Mantl 0.5.1, you'll need to run the "playbooks
/upgrade-mesos-marathon.yml" playbook before reprovisioning your
cluster to 1.0. The packaging format changed in the 1.0 release, this
will ensure a smooth upgrade.

Upgrades from releases prior to Mantl 0.5.1 have not been tested.


Variables
=========

You can use these variables to customize your Mesos installation.

mesos_mode

   Set to "leader" for leader mode, and "follower" for follower mode.
   Set to "mixed" to run both leader and follower on the same machine
   (useful for development or testing.)

   default: "follower"

mesos_log_dir

   default: "/var/log/mesos"

mesos_work_dir

   default: "/var/run/mesos"

mesos_leader_port

   default: "5050"

mesos_follower_port

   default: "5051"

mesos_leader_cmd

   default: "mesos-master"

mesos_follower_cmd

   default: "mesos-slave"

mesos_attributes
Set attributes for mesos agents.
Provide these as a list to set multiple attributes. Format:
`` - "key:value"
- "key:value"``

   default: "node_id:{{ inventory_hostname }}"

mesos_resources

   Set resources for mesos agents. (useful for setting available ports
   that applications can be bound to). Provide these as a list to set
   multiple resources. Format: >>``<<- name(role):value

      * name(role):value...``

   default: "ports(*):[4000-5000, 7000-8000, 9000-10000, 25000-26000,
   31000-32000]"

mesos_cluster

   default: "mantl"

mesos_zk_hosts

   A ZooKeeper connection string in the the "host:mesos_zk_port"
   format, generated from the hosts in "zookeeper_server_group".

mesos_zk_dns

   Consul DNS entries for ZooKeeper hosts.

   default: "zookeeper.service.consul"

mesos_zk_port

   default: "2181"

mesos_zk_chroot

   ZooKeeper znode to use as a base for mesos data.

   default: "mesos"

mesos_credentials

   A list of credentials to add for authentication. These should be in
   the form "{ principal: "...", secret: "..." }".

   default: "[]"

mesos_authenticate_frameworks

   Enable Mesos authentication for frameworks. You should set
   "mesos_credentials" for credentials if this is set.

   default: set automatically if framework credentials are present

mesos_authenticate_followers

   Enable Mesos authentication from followers. If set, each follower
   will need "mesos_follower_secret" set in their host variables.

   default: set automatically if follower credentials are present

mesos_follower_principal

   The principal to use for follower authentication

   default: "follower"

mesos_follower_secret

   The secret to use for follower authentication

   default: not set. Set this to enable follower authentication.

mesos_logging_level

   The log level for Mesos. This is set for all components.

   Default: "WARNING"
