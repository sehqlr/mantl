Bare-Metal
==========

By bare-metal we mean a set of physical computers that have Centos 7
installed on them.

If you are using Openstack, VMware, or some other cloud provider,
Mantl.io has terraform scripts for you. From a Mantl.io perspective,
this doc is about setting up the inventory file by hand and preparing
the machines to a state similar to what terraform would have done.

The minimum requirements for installing Mantl (based on the AWS sample) are
edge, control and worker nodes with 1 core and about 4 GB of RAM.  This
documentation is really a description of how to set up a static inventory file
when you don't create your inventory with ``terraform.py``.  There is nothing
about this document that requires that they be physical systems.

This document explains:
 * Preparing your machines with Centos
 * Network and storage concerns
 * Creating your inventory
 * Setting up Ansible

Setting Up Centos 7
-------------------

Thumb Drive Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are much more professional ways of creating your instances, but if
you are looking for a solution for a couple machines at home, perhaps
you actually need some tips on how to do it. The least technical way to
do this is with a thumb drive.

Create a bootable USB drive with Centos 7. This can be a bit confusing, we
recommend the following two tutorials for OSX:

 * http://www.myiphoneadventure.com/os-x/create-a-bootable-centos-usb-drive-with-a-mac-os-x
 * http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx

Mantl.io requires the latest build of Centos 7.

During installation you will use the defaults except:

-  Manually configure your partitions. On the Manual partioning page:
-  Remove existing partitions
-  Press the button to automatically partition. This will give you a
   default set to start with.
-  The automatic partioning will put 50 toward root and the rest in
   home, change this:

   -  These are services machines and won't store many files in home,
      Home should be set to a small partion size leaving you with some
      unpartioned space.
   -  You will need to leave unformatted space on the drive for docker.
      Try to leave at least 50 unformated for the docker LVM partion
      that is described in the "Create Partion for Docker LVM" section
      below.

-  Turn on your wired internet connection. It should just be a toggle
   switch for your device.
-  Once the install starts it asks for a root password and a first user.
-  Having a ``centos`` admin user will match what happens in cloud
   environments.

Once rebooted, if you forgot to turn on your internet in the install,
you can set it up using the following tutorial:
http://www.krizna.com/centos/setup-network-centos-7/ . It might be
easier and more automated (therefore less error prone) to just reinstall
and remember to turn on your internet during the install.

Set up Base Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chosing a static IP range
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I chose 172.16.222.x because its unlikely to overlap with any network I
might move this cluster too.

Give it a static IP and set DNS and Gateway
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://ask.xmodulo.com/configure-static-ip-address-centos7.html

At the command line enter:

::

    ip addr

You should see somethng like:

::

    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
        inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 ::1/128 scope host
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    2: eno1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
        link/ether b8:ae:ed:71:6c:06 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 172.16.222.22/24 brd 172.16.222.255 scope global eno1
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 fe80::baae:edff:fe71:6c06/64 scope link
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

from this you can see that eno1 is the ethernet device.

Edit ``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno1``

You can leave everything that is in there but you need to to change or
add the following. BOOTPROTO and ONBOOT are probably already there.

::

    BOOTPROTO="static"
    IPADDR="172.16.222.6"
    GATEWAY="172.16.222.1"
    NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
    DNS1="8.8.8.8"
    DNS2="208.67.222.222"
    NM_CONTROLLED=no
    ONBOOT="yes"

The DNS lines are going to have to change once consul is up.

NOTE: in Centos 7 /etc/resolv.conf is a generated file.

You could also put the dns lines in /etc/sysconfig/network.

Permanently change your hostname with:

::

    hostnamectl set-hostname edge22

After saving then finally:

::

    systemctl restart network

Create Partion For Docker LVM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  su
-  parted /dev/sda print
-  fdisk /dev/sda
-  Command: n
-  partion : default
-  please note which partition it is in. So if its partition 5,
   eventually you will need to tell mantl /dev/sda5 for the LVM
-  you kinda want all your machines to use the same partition because
   this partition is entered as a system wide variable.
-  first sector: default
-  last sector: +50G
-  Command: w

-  reboot

Don't put a file system on the partion.

Note that I am creating a partion size 50 Gigs, this is for docker. Just
make it consistent across your cluster.

There are two main types of drives on the market today. The older type
of drive is said to have MS-DOS partions. When partioning these types of
drives you will be asked if you want to create a ``primary`` partion or
a ``extended`` partition. You will need to make it a ``primary``
partition.

Additionally, if you have a MS-DOS partioned drive you may have to run
the following patch:
https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/issues/1504 against
the file /Library/lvg.py. If during the ansible run (as described in the
section "Run It!" below) the run hangs on task ``lvm | create volume
group`` then you will need to follow the instructions in issue 1504.

Creating Your Inventory
-----------------------

Here is an example inventory file. It should be placed in the root of
the mantl directory.

::

    [role=control]
    control-01 private_ipv4=172.16.222.6 ansible_ssh_host=172.16.222.6
    control-02 private_ipv4=172.16.222.7 ansible_ssh_host=172.16.222.7
    control-03 private_ipv4=172.16.222.8 ansible_ssh_host=172.16.222.8

    [role=control:vars]
    consul_is_server=true
    lvm_physical_device=/dev/sda3

    [role=worker]
    worker-001 private_ipv4=172.16.222.11 ansible_ssh_host=172.16.222.11
    worker-002 private_ipv4=172.16.222.12 ansible_ssh_host=172.16.222.12
    worker-003 private_ipv4=172.16.222.13 ansible_ssh_host=172.16.222.13

    [role=worker:vars]
    consul_is_server=false
    lvm_physical_device=/dev/sda3

    [role=edge]
    edge-01 private_ipv4=172.16.222.16 ansible_ssh_host=172.16.222.16
    edge-02 private_ipv4=172.16.222.17 ansible_ssh_host=172.16.222.17

    [role=edge:vars]
    consul_is_server=false
    lvm_physical_device=/dev/sda3

    [dc=dc1]
    control-01
    control-02
    control-03
    worker-001
    worker-002
    worker-003
    edge-01
    edge-02

I had to add the ``ansible_ssh_host`` line to run
``playbooks/reboot-hosts.yml`` and the ``private_ipv4`` is needed by several
roles.

The ``dc=dc1`` group is needed to set ``consul_dc_group`` in the consul role.
It is used in the dnsmasq role.  ``dc1`` is the default. If you change the name
of the data center in your inventory file you will need to set the ``consul_dc``
variable. For example, if you called your dc 'mydc' then you would need to
enter:

::

    ansible-playbook -u centos -i inventory -e consul_dc=mydc \
            -e provider=bare-metal  -e @security.yml  sample.yml >& bare-metal.log

The rest of the options will be discussed below.

Getting Started with Ansible
----------------------------

Add your key to all the machines in your inventory

::

    ansible all -i inventory  -u centos -k -m authorized_key -a "user=centos key=https://github.com/youraccount.keys"

Note this makes use of your public key on Github. If you don't have a
Github account or a key pair on your Github account, please look at the
documentation for Ansible ``authorized_key`` module for other options.

The ``-k`` is needed because the ssh connection is still uses password based
authentication.

After this authorization step has been completed, all commands can
happen without the password and ``-k`` option. Test with:

::

    ansible all -i inventory -u centos -m ping

You should get back a pong from each machine in your inventory.

Copy the /etc/host file over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add your nodes to /etc/hosts:

::

        127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
        ::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
        172.16.222.5 MyMac
        172.16.222.6 control-01
        172.16.222.7 control-02
        172.16.222.8 control-03
        172.16.222.11 worker-01
        172.16.222.12 worker-02
        172.16.222.13 worker-03
        172.16.222.16 edge-01
        172.16.222.17 edge-02

Copy the /etc/hosts file over to all your nodes:

::

    ansible all -i inventory -u centos --sudo --ask-sudo-pass -m copy -a "src=hosts dest=/etc/hosts"

Run It!
-------

You now are ready to run the playbook. Change directory to the project root.
Your inventory should be there.

Run the security-setup script:

::

    ./security-setup

It asks for one admin password. At the end of that run there will be a
``security.yml`` file. It will have the password you entered and a lot
of keys needed for installation.

The playbook you will be running is ``sample.yml``. Since you created
your own inventory and didn't use terraform, there are a few variables
you need to set for your run.

::

    ansible-playbook -u centos -i inventory \
            -e provider=bare-metal \
            -e consul_dc=dc1 \
            -e docker_lvm_backed=true \
            -e docker_lvm_data_volume_size="80%FREE" \
            -e @security.yml  sample.yml >& bare-metal.log

In another window tail -f that log file to follow whats going on.

The meaning of the parts of this command are as follows:

``ansible-playbook -u centos -i inventory``
    run the ansible play book as centos user against the inventory found in the
    ./inventory file.

``-e provider=bare-metal``
    The "provider" is bare-metal where a user sets up the infrastructure and
    then creates an inventory file as described above.  If the inventory had
    been generated by terraform.py against a terraform state file for
    infrastructure built on Google Cloud, this value would have been set
    automatically to 'gcs'

``-e consul_dc=dc1``
    This is the name found in your ./inventory file for your datacenter.

``-e docker_lvm_backed=true``
    LVM-backed docker is a really good idea in centos. This is why you craeted
    the extra partion during installation.

``-e docker_lvm_data_volume_size="80%FREE"``
    This defaults to "40%FREE" in the docker role because the default LVM
    partition is shared with other things. You could leave this off, but its
    likely with your own hardware you will have different constraints and its a
    good variable to know.

``-e @security.yml``
    This a series of variables that have all the security settings of the
    various parts of Mantl. The @ causes Ansible to evaluate the file.

``sample.yml``
    This is the ansible file that is being run.

``>& bare-metal.log``
    This redirects the output to a file so that you can review it later.
    Tailing with a -f flag lets you watch the progress as ansible works through
    the rolls accross your inventory.

Once you are done go to the browser and go to the IP address of any
control node and you should see the Mantl UI. For the inventory shown
above, you could go to ``172.16.222.6/ui``.
