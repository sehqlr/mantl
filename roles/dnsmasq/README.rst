dnsmasq
=======

The project uses `dnsmasq <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html>`_ to
configure each host to use :doc:`consul` for DNS.

This role also adds (as of Mantl 1.1) search paths for ``.consul`` and
``.node.consul``. This means that you can address your nodes by their consul
names directly: if you have a node named ``x``, you can address it there or at
``x.node``, as well as the fully-qualified ``x.node.consul``. You can also
address services using the shortened version (for example ``zookeeper.service``
instead of the full ``zookeeper.service.consul``.)

Changes
-------

.. versionadded: 1.0.4

Starting with version 1.0.4, dnsmasq no longer uses Google's DNS (``8.8.8.8``
and ``8.8.4.4``), preferring the cloud provider's DNS. If you want to use the
old behavior, add your preferred nameservers to ``/etc/resolv.conf.masq``, where
DNSMasq will look to load resolvers after a name is not found in Consul.

Variables
---------

The dnsmasq role uses ``consul_servers_group`` and ``consul_dc_group`` defined
in :doc:`consul`.

.. data:: mantl_dns_version
