iptables - firewall rules ======

The iptables role limits incoming IP traffic, so that only servers
within the cluster can communicate with each other. The iptables rules
are updated dynamically using consul-template.

Some exceptions are: - A custom whitelist of IP addresses are allowed -
SSH access is allowed from everywhere - Consul ports are open, but
rate-limited (to allow new members to join the cluster)

All outgoing traffic from the cluster to the Internet is permitted.
Forwarding is enabled so that docker containers can contact each other
and its host worker nodes. Every server within the cluster can contact
the docker containers.

This is a community supported addon, and will not be tested as
frequently as core Mantl components.
