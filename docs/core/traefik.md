Traefik
=======

!!! note ""
	new in version 0.5

[Traefik](https://traefik.io/) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load
balancer made to deploy microservices with ease. It supports several
backends (Docker, Mesos/Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Zookeeper, BoltDB, Rest
API, fileâ€¦) to manage its configuration automatically and dynamically.

Traefik is used as the only work role on the edge nodes. You should
customize `traefik_marathon_domain` to set a domain (for example
`apps.yourdomain.com`) and then set an A record for each of the edge
servers to `*.apps.yourdomain.com`.

Migrating from haproxy
----------------------

In 0.5, this role replaces haproxy. To migrate, set
`traefik_marathon_domain` to whatever was previously the value of
`haproxy_domain` and make sure your customized config has the new role
from `sample.yml`.

Variables
---------

You can use these variables to customize your Traefik installation.

traefik\_marathon\_endpoint
:   The endpoint that Marathon talks to. Do not change this unless you are using non-default security settings (namely, if you have iptables disabled, this could also be set to `http://marathon.service.consul:8080`)
:   **default**: `http://marathon.service.consul:18080`

traefik\_marathon\_domain
:   The domain that Traefik will match hosts on by default (you can [change this on a per-app basis](http://traefik.readthedocs.org/en/latest/backends/#marathon-backend))
:   **default**: `marathon.localhost`

traefik\_marathon\_expose\_by\_default
:   Automatically expose Marathon applications in traefik. The traefik default is `false`, or not forward traffic. The mantl default is set to `true`.
